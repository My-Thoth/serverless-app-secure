It seems like I canâ€™t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later. If you'd like, I can guide you on how to create the README file manually for your project.

Here's a draft of the README that you can use:

# Country-City Dropdown API

This project is a simple RESTful API built using Flask that allows users to fetch country and city data. The API can be used to populate a country dropdown and based on the selected country, a corresponding city dropdown can be populated dynamically. It is a useful tool for implementing location-based dropdowns in various applications.

## Features
- **GET `/api/countries/`**: Fetches a list of countries available in the database.
- **GET `/api/cities/`**: Fetches a list of all cities in the database.
- **GET `/api/countries/{country_code}/cities/`**: Fetches a list of cities for a given country code.

Additionally, there is an endpoint that can be embedded in a frontend dropdown to allow users to select a country and then dynamically load the cities based on the selected country.

### Example of Country Dropdown
- **URL**: `/select-country`
- This endpoint renders a page with a country dropdown where users can select a country. Once a country is selected, the corresponding cities will be populated in a city dropdown.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/country-city-dropdown-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd country-city-dropdown-api
   ```

3. Set up your virtual environment:
   - **For macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **For Windows**:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create the `.env` file in the root of the project with the following environment variables:
   ```bash
   FLASK_APP=app
   FLASK_ENV=development
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname
   ```
   Make sure to replace `username`, `password`, and `dbname` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

6. Run the database migrations to set up your PostgreSQL database:
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

7. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

The application will be running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You can test the API endpoints and see the dropdown functionality.

## Docker Setup (Optional)

If you prefer to deploy this application using Docker, you can follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t country-city-dropdown-api .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 country-city-dropdown-api
   ```

The application will now be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
